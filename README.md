#ABOUT THIS REPO

This is the backend of the project named Retrocraft. I have used Express in the backend and MongoDB as the database. I have used JWT(json-web-token) for Authentication. I have used the concept
of Accesstokens and Refresh tokens. I have also implemented filtering functionalities in the backend. I am still working on it. My website is live at retrocraft-fontend.onrender.com. 
Major learnings are :- How to implement filters, authentication, calling databases, making models and Schemas in MongoDb.
